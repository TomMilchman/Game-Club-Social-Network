Game Club - A Gaming Social Network

This is a small university project that I had to program for one of my courses. 
Every user may create and read posts about gaming, follow other users to see their posts in their feed and follow gaming news and trivia.
Admin has the ability to disable/enable certain features, see user activity log and delete users from the social network.
