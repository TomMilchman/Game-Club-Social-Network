# Game Club - A Gaming Social Network

## Overview
A small gaming-centered social network developed in React TypeScript.
Every user may create and read posts about gaming, follow other users to see their posts in their feed, and follow gaming news and trivia.
Admin can disable/enable certain features, see user activity logs, and delete users from the social network.

## Setup
Run the server with "node server.js" and run the client with "npm run dev". Then go to http://localhost:5173 in your browser. To run the tests, run "node test.js".
If you wish to log in as an admin, use the username "admin" and password "admin".
